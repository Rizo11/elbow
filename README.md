## 🛠️ Project Overview

This project showcases the design and implementation of a **cable-driven robotic elbow joint** inspired by human arm dynamics. The goal was to achieve high stiffness and low inertia using a **tension amplification mechanism**, making it suitable for robotics applications such as human-robot collaboration and lightweight manipulators.

---

## 🔍 Features
- **Tension Amplification Mechanism**: Increases joint stiffness quadratically, maintaining low mass and inertia.  
- **Lightweight Design**: Combines 3D-printed components and aluminum alloy for reduced weight.

---

## 📐 Design Details
- **Tools Used**: Siemens NX for CAD modeling and mechanical design.
